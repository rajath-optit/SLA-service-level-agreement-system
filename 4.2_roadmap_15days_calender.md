#### **Day 6: Implement User Management**
- **Goals**: Build user registration and authentication features.
- **Actions**:
  - Implement user registration, login, and role-based access control.
  - Use libraries or frameworks for authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
- **Output**: User management system functional.

#### **Day 7: Build Core SLA Features**
- **Goals**: Develop core SLA functionalities.
- **Actions**:
  - Implement features for creating and managing SLAs.
  - Allow users to define services, metrics, and responsibilities.
- **Output**: Basic SLA creation and management features.

#### **Day 8: Develop Monitoring System**
- **Goals**: Create a monitoring mechanism for performance metrics.
- **Actions**:
  - Implement tools or scripts for tracking service performance.
  - Integrate third-party monitoring tools (if necessary).
- **Output**: Monitoring system in place.

#### **Day 9: Implement Reporting Features**
- **Goals**: Create reporting functionality for SLA performance.
- **Actions**:
  - Develop features to generate and export performance reports.
  - Allow users to view historical SLA data.
- **Output**: Reporting features ready for user access.

#### **Day 10: Define Penalties and Remedies**
- **Goals**: Establish penalties for SLA non-compliance.
- **Actions**:
  - Allow users to define penalties within their SLAs.
  - Implement features for automatic notifications on SLA breaches.
- **Output**: SLA penalties and notification system implemented.

#### **Day 11: User Interface Enhancements**
- **Goals**: Polish the user interface for better user experience.
- **Actions**:
  - Improve the design and usability of the application.
  - Ensure the UI is responsive for different devices.
- **Output**: Enhanced and user-friendly interface.

#### **Day 12: Test the Application**
- **Goals**: Perform testing to ensure everything works as expected.
- **Actions**:
  - Conduct unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
  - Gather feedback from test users.
- **Output**: A tested and functional SaaS application.

#### **Day 13: Documentation**
- **Goals**: Prepare documentation for users and developers.
- **Actions**:
  - Create user guides and API documentation.
  - Document the code for future reference and maintenance.
- **Output**: Comprehensive documentation completed.

#### **Day 14: Marketing and Launch Preparation**
- **Goals**: Prepare for the launch of the SaaS product.
- **Actions**:
  - Create a marketing plan (website, social media, etc.).
  - Set up onboarding processes for new users.
- **Output**: A marketing strategy ready for implementation.

#### **Day 15: Final Review and Launch**
- **Goals**: Conduct a final review and launch the product.
- **Actions**:

### Tips for Success
- **Agile Approach**: Consider using Agile methodologies to iterate quickly based on feedback.
- **User Feedback**: Engage with potential users early to refine your features based on their needs.
- **Focus on MVP**: Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to launch quickly and then expand features based on user feedback.
- **Monitor Launch**: After launching, actively monitor for any issues or user feedback to address quickly.

This roadmap should help you effectively plan and execute the development of your SLA system as a SaaS product.
